# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-and-Custom-Image-Upload
This project demonstrates how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the MNIST dataset and then use it to recognize handwritten numbers from uploaded images. It includes digit segmentation, prediction, number-to-words conversion, and an interactive image upload interface in Google Colab.
